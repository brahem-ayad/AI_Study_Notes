# Day 1 (2025/24/7) :
- Learning what is AI
- The different types of AI
  - Rule-based systems (basic logic, decision trees)
  - Learning-based systems (ML/DL)

I am not sure yet if i have to use python or if i can use C++.
Also do i need to learn more about Linear Algebra, Statistics, Data Structuers and Algorithms ?
Also do i need to learn what Tensors are ?

I also had some ideas for projects to make :

Projects that are (Rule-based) :
- A Floor-cleaning robot that can cover any Area given to it, efficiently.
- A Chess Engine
- A video game anime (pong for example)

Projects that are (Learning-based) :
- A drawing area where you can draw a number 1,2,3,... and an AI will try to determine what number you drew.
- An AI that can determine if the picture given to him containes a car, or a dog.
